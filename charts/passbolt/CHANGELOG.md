## [0.2.0] - 2023-03-17

This release contains breaking changes!!!

In order to support rootless container images we have removed the installation of php-redis
during the deployment and moved such dependency to passbolt debian packages. (Rootless container images
do not allow to install packages for obvious reasons).
By moving the php-redis dependency to our debian packages there is no need to install anything
during the deployment of this chart.

The downside however is that now this chart requires passbolt-3.12.0-3 as minimal docker image.

We have also include a few contributions from the community, thanks to all of you who helped during this release!

### Added

- [#6](https://github.com/passbolt/charts-passbolt/pull/6) make kubectl more flexible
- Support for rootless images in HA scenarios
